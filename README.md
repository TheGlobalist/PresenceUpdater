This is a Python Script that I did for updating the presences of the players of my rugby team in Italian Rugby's Super 10.
Taking as input (via CLI) the players that will attend the match, the script asks for the name of the file and will do the rest.
Attached to the script, you will find a sample of how this file should look like. Note that it will only accept .txt files
